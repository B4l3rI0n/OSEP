Using **iCalendar (.ics)** files as a phishing technique enables attackers to bypass traditional email filters and exploit users' trust in calendar invitations. This technique involves sending customized calendar invites with embedded malicious content, often mimicking legitimate platforms like Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

**Calendar Phishing** leverages ICS (iCalendar) files to deliver deceptive invitations containing malicious links or payloads. ICS files are automatically parsed and scheduled by email clients (e.g., Outlook, Gmail), allowing attackers to:

- **Bypass spam filters**
- **Embed phishing links**
- **Create persistent reminders in victim calendars**
